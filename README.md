# **TCC Security Systems — Executive Sales & Budget Dashboard (Excel)**

## **Overview**
This project presents an executive-level **Excel dashboard** for **TCC Security Systems**, built to provide a clear, decision-ready view of **potential deal size, security budgets, product demand, urgency levels, sales stages, and geographic performance** across multiple banks and countries.  
The dashboard is designed for fast leadership insights and practical sales prioritization.

---

## **Business Context**
Large-scale security solutions for financial institutions require tight alignment between:
- **client security budgets**
- **pipeline opportunity**
- **product demand**
- **urgency-driven decision-making**

This dashboard consolidates these signals into one interactive view to support smarter targeting, faster conversion, and more confident market expansion.

## **Key Metrics (Dashboard Summary)**
- **Total Potential Deal Size:** **$4M**  
- **Total Security Budget:** **$14M**  
- **Average Security Budget:** **$499K**  
- **Bank Branches Covered:** **6K**  
- **Total Banks:** **13**  
- **Countries Covered:** **22**

## **Dashboard Features**
- **Executive KPI cards** for quick performance scanning  
- **Potential Deal Size vs Security Budget** comparison by bank  
- **Monthly trend analysis** of deal size and security budget  
- **Product Type distribution** to understand solution demand  
- **Urgency Level breakdown** for prioritization  
- **Sales stages by total deal value** to assess pipeline health  
- **Country performance summary** for regional strategy  
- Interactive filtering by:
  - **Month**
  - **Urgency Level**

---

## **Key Insights**
- **Total security budgets significantly exceed total potential deal size**, suggesting strong market capacity for:
  - upselling premium security packages  
  - expanding multi-branch rollouts  
  - bundling complementary solutions  
- **Pipeline value appears concentrated in later sales stages** (e.g., Proposal/Qualified), indicating that **conversion-focused execution** could yield faster returns than broad prospecting alone.  
- **Product demand is diversified** across major solution types, supporting a balanced go-to-market and inventory strategy.  
- **Country-level results highlight clear leading markets**, enabling smarter prioritization of sales and partnerships.  
- The presence of **high-urgency opportunities** suggests that response speed can meaningfully influence win rates.

## **Recommendations**
### **1. Implement urgency-based sales prioritization**
Adopt a simple operating rule:
- **High urgency + high budget** → immediate executive/senior rep focus  
- **High urgency + lower budget** → propose phased implementation and scalable packages  

This ensures fast wins while protecting long-term account value.

### **2. Target “budget-ready” expansion opportunities**
Use the relationship between **Security Budget** and **Potential Deal Size** to identify banks with:
- strong budget capacity  
- under-sized opportunity estimates  

Recommended actions:
- propose **branch-wide or multi-region expansion**
- introduce **bundle upgrades** across product categories

### **3. Strengthen late-stage conversion**
Because later stages represent the strongest near-term value:
- assign senior reps to **Proposal** and **Qualified** accounts  
- standardize negotiation playbooks  
- introduce tiered pricing packages  

This improves forecast confidence and conversion speed.

### **4. Expand in top-performing countries first**
Use the country summary to:
- focus marketing, partnerships, and sales leadership in highest-value markets  
- validate demand before scaling into lower-performing regions  

This reduces expansion risk and increases ROI.

### **5. Align product strategy with demand mix**
Maintain balanced offerings across:
- **Access Control Systems**
- **Safe Deposit Boxes**
- **Vault Doors**

Introduce packaged tiers:
- **Standard Security Package**  
- **Advanced Branch Package**  
- **Premium Full-Suite Package**

This supports upsell and simplifies client decision-making.

### **6. Establish a monthly executive review cadence**
Use the month filter to lead:
- pipeline health reviews  
- urgency escalation checks  
- budget-readiness tracking  

This improves alignment between sales strategy and market opportunity.
